              Welcome to MEDIA EYE NFT Portal, these Privacy Policy and Terms of
              Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the MEDIA EYE
              website(s), our APIs, mobile app (the “App”), and any other
              software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in
              connection with our services; including without limitation using
              our services to view, explore, and create NFTs and use our tools,
              at your own discretion, to connect directly with others to
              purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains
              (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in these Terms means a
              non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a
              blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart
              contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain
              content or data.
            </p>
            <p>
              For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means you
              as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a
              company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity,
              and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized
              representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity
              to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s
              behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN
              IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN
              SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
              AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE
              ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL
              ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN COURT.

              BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE
              BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
              REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS
              OR USE THE SERVICE.
            </p>
            <p>
              MEDIA EYE is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial
              institution, or creditor. MEDIA EYE provides a peer-to-peer web3
              service that helps users discover and directly interact with each
              other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have
              custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are
              interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases,
              transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a
              third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on
              blockchains.
            </p>
            <p>
              MEDIA EYE is not party to any agreement between any users. You
              bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy,
              and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party
              sellers using the Service and we make no claims about the
              identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or
              NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the
              Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to
              provide additional terms for specific services (and such services
              are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be
              subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions,
              which are available with the relevant service, then become part of
              your agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of
              a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms
              we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall
              control for that specific service.
            </p>
            <p>
              MEDIA EYE reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at
              any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material changes
              to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice
              of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service
              or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these
              Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm
              your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms
              incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these
              Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the
              Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that
              you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access
              or use the Service.

            <span className="text-medium">Accessing the Service</span>
            <p>
              Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your
              identity on MEDIA EYE. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain
              address and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your
              account on the service (“Account”) will be associated with your
              blockchain address; however, if you want to add some flair to your
              MEDIA EYE persona, you can add additional information, such as a
              profile picture, to your Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Account on MEDIA EYE will be associated with your linked
              blockchain address and display the NFTs for that blockchain
              address (and, if applicable, any content associated with such
              NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you
              agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and
              conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are
              not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with MEDIA EYE, and
              MEDIA EYE does not have custody or control over the contents of
              your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its
              contents. MEDIA EYE accepts no responsibility for, or liability to
              you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no
              representations or warranties regarding how the Service will
              operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for
              keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet
              credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue
              related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.
              Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any
              associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions
              by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your
              Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately
              notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues
              related to the Service or your Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all
              applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when
              using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the
              Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located
              in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo; and (b)
              you have not been identified as a Specially Designated National or
              placed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited, sanctioned, or
              restricted parties. If you access or use the Service outside the
              United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your
              access and use of the Service in such country, territory or
              jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              MEDIA EYE may require you to provide additional information and
              documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any
              government authority, as any applicable law or regulation
              dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms.
              In such cases, MEDIA EYE, in its sole discretion, may disable your
              Account and block your ability to access the Service until such
              additional information and documents are processed by MEDIA EYE.
              If you do not provide complete and accurate information in
              response to such a request, MEDIA EYEmay refuse to restore your
              access to the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to
              time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation,
              the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or
              repair of the Service or other actions that MEDIA EYE, in its sole
              discretion, may elect to take.
            </p>

              We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are at
              least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use MEDIA
              EYE through a parent or guardian’s Account and with their approval
              and oversight. That account holder is responsible for your actions
              using the Account. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are
              under 13 years old.

            <p>
              As a peer-to-peer web3 service, MEDIA EYE helps you explore NFTs
              created by third parties and interact with different blockchains.
              MEDIA EYE does not make any representations or warranties about
              this third-party content visible through our Service, including
              any content associated with NFTs displayed on the Service, and you
              bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity,
              and legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers.
              We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on MEDIA EYE will
              always remain visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or
              transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers
              with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated
              with a given NFT (“Purchase Terms”). For example, when you click
              to get more details about any of the NFTs visible on MEDIA EYE,
              you may notice a third party link to the creator’s website. Such
              website may include Purchase Terms governing the use of the NFT
              that you will be required to comply with. MEDIA EYE is not a party
              to any such Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and
              the seller. The buyer and seller are entirely responsible for
              communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase
              Terms. You are solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase
              Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Service may also contain links or functionality to access or
              use third-party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications
              (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display, include, or
              make available content, data, information, services, applications,
              or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”). When
              you click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website
              or Third-Party Application, though we may not warn you that you
              have left our Service, you are subject to the terms and conditions
              (including privacy policies) of another website or destination.
              Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and
              Third-Party Materials are not under the control of MEDIA EYE, and

              MEDIA EYE is not responsible or liable for any Third-Party

              EYE relating to your access to and use of the Service. These
              Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
              transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent
              of MEDIA EYE, and MEDIA EYE’s failure to assert any right or
              provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
              right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or
              default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding
              or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein
              are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal
              effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Service is operated by us in the United States. Those who
              choose to access the Service from locations outside the United
              States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for
              compliance with applicable local laws. You and MEDIA EYE agree
              that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation
              or construction of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
              solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to
              confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or
              entity.
