    question: 'What are eYe tokens? And how could eYe benefit me?',
    Answer: () => (
      <p>
        eYe token is a multi-chain cryptographic unit designed as a utility and
        rewards token providing the ability to receive discounts for MEDIA EYE
        services, participate in Farming collected fees and Staking. MEDIA EYE
        token takes users far beyond simply holding a token for value
        appreciation, eYe holders will greatly profit from the redistribution of
        50% of all fees collected by the platform on multiple blockchains
        through the “eYe Cohort Farms”. That is a MASSIVE percentage of overall
        fees, seldom seen in viable projects these days. Holders will also
        benefit from a 15% reduction on select platform services at the time of
        payment. In addition, holders will be able to participate in eYe NFT
        Airdrops and Events, which will also offer users ways to earn, have and
        receive rewards.

    question: 'What is “Cohort Farming”?',
    Answer: () => (
      <p>
        In a nutshell, by staking your eYe tokens, you can earn multiple tokens
        simultaneously at variable rates. Tokens earned are native to the chain
        on which you are staking, so for example staking on the Binance Smart
        Chain token holders can earn eYe, WBNB, and BUSD tokens.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'When will Cohort Farming be available?',
    Answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>
          Cohort farming is live. As the platform expands across multiple
          blockchains, each market where the farms are launched will offer
          participation in collecting fees, you can also farm eYe tokens by
          staking your eYe tokens. The current APR across all blockchains is
          120%!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once the platform is launched and starts collecting fees, you will
          also be farming WBNB and BUSD on the BSC, and USDT and WETH on
          Ethereum, plus FTM token on Fantom.

    question:
      'How do I bridge my eYe tokens from BSC to Ethereum or Ethereum to BSC and other blockchains like FTM that eYe is bridged on?',
    Answer: () => (
      <>
        <p>Bridging your eYe tokens is a straightforward 6-step process.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to the following{' '}
            <a
              href="https://cross.swapz.app/#/swap/0x8CEcB942E9001782f8Ed7c04bBa7ee0AB6f8f3ae"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
            >
              link
            </a>{' '}
            and tou will see the eYe token already selected (Should it not be,
            you can easily select it using the drop-down menu).
          </li>
          <li>Connect your wallet.</li>
          <li>
            Select the chain where your tokens are (on the left) and the chain
            where your tokens are going (on the right). If this is your first
            time using Swapz, your wallet will prompt you twice to approve the
            connection to both chains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert the number of eYe tokens you wish to bridge in the numeric
            field and click the swap button.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new page displaying the token amount to be bridged over will load.
            Once you are ready to proceed, hit the “Allow to Swap” button. A
            flat fee of 0.15 BNB will be charged for bridging from BSC to
            Ethereum, and 0.004 ETH when bridging from Ethereum to BSC, ensure
            you have sufficient BNB/ETH in your wallet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your wallet will prompt you to approve the transaction gas fee.
            Approve and that’s it, your tokens will be bridged shortly!
          </li>
          <li>
            eYe on Fantom is also in our plans for Q1-Q2 of 2022, as we expand
            markets for eYe tokens across all blockchains where MEDIA EYE
            operates.

          aiming for February 2022 for full Beta release on BSC and Fantom with
          release on Ethereum shortly after Beta operation has commenced. This
          is to avoid having to redeploy contracts on Ethereum which is well

          </li>
          <li>
            Every vested piece is distributed equally (50%/50%) in eYe tokens on
            BSC and eYe tokens on Ethereum.
          </li>
          <li>The next distribution date is: February 22, 2022</li>
